- The REST frontend (where we use an older version of the Tonic PHP REST
API) takes Requests on REST URI Resources and produces Responses.

- HTTP Request data is parsed through an import filter into an internal
RESTfmData object/format (which looks remarkably similar to the .txt
format you get from the RESTfm web API (see manual)).
  - All of the RFM* flags and arguments (see manual) are also parsed out
here.

- The request RESTfmData is passed to a backend database for processing,
which returns another RESTfmData object in response.

- The response RESTfmData is parsed through an export filter for the
final HTTP Response that is returned.
